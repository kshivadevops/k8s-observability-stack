Here's a sample README.md file that you can use to document the setup of the Kubernetes Observability Stack:


# Kubernetes Observability Stack

This repository contains the setup for a comprehensive Kubernetes Observability Stack using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Jaeger**, and **Fluent Bit**. It includes Helm charts for each component, which are configured to work together to monitor and trace your Kubernetes clusters effectively.

## Stack Overview

- **Prometheus**: A powerful monitoring and alerting toolkit that collects and stores metrics as time series data.
- **Grafana**: A dashboard and visualization tool used to visualize metrics and logs stored by Prometheus.
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing to monitor and troubleshoot microservices-based applications.
- **Fluent Bit**: A lightweight log processor and forwarder that sends logs to Elasticsearch (or another logging backend).

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the stack, ensure you have the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster (e.g., using **kubectl** to interact with your Kubernetes cluster).
- **Helm** installed to deploy the charts.
- **kubectl** configured to point to your Kubernetes cluster.

├── scripts/                    # Helper scripts (e.g., for installations or upgrades)
charts/: Contains Helm charts for each observability tool.

values.yaml: Contains global settings to configure common settings like resource limits and namespaces.

scripts/: Contains helper scripts to automate the deployment process.

Configuration
The values.yaml file in the root directory contains global configuration settings that are shared across all Helm charts. Modify this file to suit your resource requirements, storage classes, and other settings.

Configuration in values.yaml
Namespace: The namespace for deploying all components (observability by default).

Resource Requests/Limits: Define the resource requests and limits for CPU and memory for each service.

Persistence: Configure storage for Prometheus and Grafana data (for durability).

Alerting: Enable and configure alerting for Prometheus.

Deployment Instructions
Follow these steps to deploy the observability stack on your Kubernetes cluster.

1. Clone this Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/k8s-observability-stack.git
cd k8s-observability-stack
2. Install Helm (If not installed)
If you do not have Helm installed, follow the instructions for your operating system from the Helm installation guide.

3. Modify Configuration (Optional)
Before deploying, you can modify the values.yaml file to adjust resource limits, storage configurations, and other settings.

4. Deploy the Observability Stack
You can deploy the entire stack by running the following script, which installs Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Fluent Bit:


./scripts/deploy.sh
This script will:

Install Prometheus using the Helm chart.

Install Grafana using the Helm chart.

Install Jaeger using the Helm chart.

Install Fluent Bit using the Helm chart.

5. Access the Dashboards
Once the stack is deployed, you can access the Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger dashboards as follows:

Prometheus: Access Prometheus at http://<PROMETHEUS-POD-IP>:9090.

Grafana: Access Grafana at http://<GRAFANA-POD-IP>:3000. Login with admin as both the username and password (this can be changed in the values.yaml).

Jaeger: Access Jaeger at http://<JAEGER-POD-IP>:16686.

You can also expose these services externally using kubectl port-forward or configure an Ingress for production use.

6. Clean Up
To remove the entire observability stack, you can run:


helm uninstall prometheus --namespace observability
helm uninstall grafana --namespace observability
helm uninstall jaeger --namespace observability
helm uninstall fluentbit --namespace observability
7. Logs & Traces
Fluent Bit collects logs from the Kubernetes pods and forwards them to Elasticsearch or another backend (configured in the values.yaml).

Prometheus collects metrics from your Kubernetes services and other endpoints.

Jaeger provides distributed tracing for monitoring microservices.

8. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment, you can check the logs of individual pods using:


kubectl logs <pod-name> -n observability
For more advanced troubleshooting, check the Helm chart documentation for each tool or refer to the logs of the corresponding Kubernetes pods.

Conclusion
With this Kubernetes Observability Stack, you can easily monitor and visualize the health, metrics, and logs of your Kubernetes cluster and applications. The stack includes powerful tools like Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for visualization, Jaeger for distributed tracing, and Fluent Bit for log forwarding, giving you full observability into your Kubernetes environment.

Feel free to customize the configuration and expand this stack based on your specific needs.
